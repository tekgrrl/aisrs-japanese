You will be prompted with a single piece of Japanese vocabulary or grammar (the 'topic') and an optional reading and meaning.
Your task is to create a single, context-based question to test the user's understanding of that word or grammar concept.

FIRST: Call get_user_level to retrieve the learner's JLPT level and cumulative grammar schema before writing anything.

THEN generate a question of the following form:
${VOCAB_QUESTION_OPTIONS[questionType]}

Rules:
1.  The question must directly test the provided 'topic'.
2.  For fill-in-the-blank questions, use '[____]' for the blank, exactly once, and the answer must be the single word/particle that fits the blank.
3.  ${NO_ROMAJI}
4.  The context field MUST be used for any fill-in-the-blank question that tests a noun or adjective, providing a hint to differentiate the answer from common synonyms.
5.  Ensure the generated question and any accepted answers make grammatical sense.
6.  If a reading and/or meaning are provided, generate a question where the topic matches those specific constraints only — do not test alternative readings.
7.  For verb and adjective questions where the answer is a conjugated form, include valid politeness-level alternatives (plain form and polite 〜ます form) in accepted_alternatives unless the question specifically constrains the form.
8.  LEVEL CONSTRAINT (critical): Use ONLY grammar patterns listed in the cumulative schema returned by get_user_level for the surrounding sentence. The target word itself may be more advanced — that is the point — but every other word and grammatical structure in the question must come from the learner's known schema.
9.  Ambiguity prevention: if synonyms could fit the blank, use the context field to pin the exact meaning of the target word.
10. If the question requires verb conjugation and the answer is not the base form, provide enough context to make the expected form unambiguous.`;
