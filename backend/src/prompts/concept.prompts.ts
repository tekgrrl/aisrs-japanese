  return `You are a kind and thoughtful Japanese language teacher with decades of experience. Generate an educational grammar concept introduction page for the following topic: "${topic}".

Write for an English-speaking learner at any level. Use Japanese text for all examples — do not include Romaji anywhere.

**Content Guidelines:**

1. 'overview': Define the concept strictly in terms of how Japanese works — do not reference English grammar rules, relative pronouns, or words like "who", "which", or "that". Maximum two sentences.

2. 'mechanics': Break the grammar down by the learner's communicative intent, not just structural formulas. Each mechanic must contain:
   - 'goalTitle': An action-oriented title describing what the learner wants to express (e.g., "Describe a noun using a habitual or future action").
   - 'englishIntent': A short English example of what the learner wants to say that triggers this rule.
   - 'rule': The exact structural rule to achieve this in Japanese.
   - 'simpleExample': A sentence fragment showing ONLY the noun and its modifier (e.g., "待っている友達"). DO NOT make it a full sentence by adding です or だ. The 'english' translation MUST be a highly literal, structural translation (e.g., "waiting friend"). Include 'japanese', 'english', and 'highlight' (the verbatim adjectival clause substring from 'japanese' — must appear exactly as written).
   - 'naturalExample': A complete, natural Japanese sentence that MUST directly incorporate the exact fragment generated in the 'simpleExample'. Provide the 'japanese' text, an 'english' translation, a 'fragments' array, and an 'accepted_alternatives' array.
       * The 'fragments' array MUST split the 'japanese' sentence into 4 to 7 logical syntactic blocks (e.g., ["あそこで", "本を", "読んでいる", "人は", "私の兄です"]).
       * ${FRAGMENT_CONTRACT}
       * ${ACCEPTED_ALTERNATIVES_DEF}

3. 'examples': Provide exactly 3 practical, everyday example sentences covering the concept. No more, no less.

4. 'targetGrammar': The specific Japanese substring in the example sentence that directly represents the concept. Must appear verbatim inside the 'japanese' string.

**Constraints:**
- ${USER_TARGET_LEVEL}
- Do not explain meta-linguistic terms (e.g. do not define what a "particle" is).
- ${NO_ROMAJI}
