Instructions:
 - The lesson should be in English. The use of Romaji anywhere in the lesson is forbidden.
 - Avoid using the following terminology: "copula", "predicate". Use of "particle" and "modifier" is acceptable.

Generate a complete grammar lesson matching this JSON schema exactly:
{
  "type": "Grammar",
  "pattern": "The grammar pattern (e.g. ～をお願いします)",
  "title": "Human-readable name (e.g. Making Requests with ～をお願いします)",
  "jlptLevel": "One of: N5, N4, N3, N2, N1",
  "meaning": "One-line summary of what this pattern expresses",
  "formation": ["How to form it (e.g. noun + をお願いします)", "One entry per variant form or sub-pattern — NEVER combine multiple variants into a single string, even with a newline"],
  "notes": "Nuance, register, common mistakes, contrast with similar patterns",
  "examples": [
    {
      "japanese": "Full example sentence",
      "english": "English translation",
      "context": "Short real-world setting label (e.g. convenience store)",
      "fragments": ["word1", "word2"],
      "accepted_alternatives": [],
      "learnableTerms": [
        { "term": "dictionary-form word from this sentence", "surfaceForm": "the exact inflected form as it literally appears in the sentence/fragments (e.g. 行きました, not 行く)", "reading": "kana reading of the dictionary form", "meaning": "short English meaning" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Provide exactly 3 examples
- When provided, ALWAYS copy the 'Example from context' data VERBATIM into examples[0], including its exact fragments and accepted_alternatives — learnableTerms is the one exception: generate it fresh for examples[0] too, since it isn't part of the original context data
- examples[1] and examples[2] MUST use completely different Japanese sentences with their own unique fragments
- If the pattern bundles multiple related words/forms (e.g. "よく / あまり / ぜんぜん + verb"), examples[1] and examples[2] MUST each use a different one of those words so all of them get exercised across the lesson, not just one repeated
- ${FRAGMENT_CONTRACT} The final fragment MUST include the sentence-ending punctuation (。). Each example must have different fragments matching its own sentence.
- ${ACCEPTED_ALTERNATIVES_DEF}
- NEVER copy fragments from one example to another
- LEARNABLE TERMS: for each example, list every standalone vocabulary word in that sentence that's substantial enough to be worth learning on its own. \`term\` MUST be the plain dictionary form (e.g. 買う, not 買った), since that's what gets searched/learned — but \`surfaceForm\` MUST be the exact inflected string as it literally appears in the sentence/fragments, since that's used to match the word back to its fragment. For unconjugated words (nouns, etc.) surfaceForm and term will be identical. EXCLUDE: the grammar pattern being taught (that's already the lesson's own subject), proper nouns/names, and function words (particles, copula). If a sentence has no such words beyond the pattern itself, return an empty array — do not force entries.
